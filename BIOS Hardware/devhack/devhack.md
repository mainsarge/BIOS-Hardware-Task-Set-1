## 1. *Objective*
Finding the values of a and b by finding the solution to the two circuits.
## 2. *How to*
For the first circuit we have to get an output of 1 inorder for the bulb to light up.
So for that,
`
A = 1
B = 0
C = 0
D = 1
`

For the second 2 sets of circuits the values are
`
B = 1
Y = 1
Z = 0
`
Finally the value of **a** would turn out to be **10011110** and that of **b** to be **11001110**.
So **a** = **158** and **b** = **206**.
Inserting the values into the simulator would give the result.
